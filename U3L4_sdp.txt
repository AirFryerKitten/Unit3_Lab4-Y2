1. if we found the element or there is no more elements to search through

2.The list of nums gets shorter and shorter getting to the base case of len(nums) == 1

3.The initial pointer should start at 0. we should increase the pointer by the point we split at when the target is greater or equal to the number at our split point

4.Using recursion it would take 4 steps at most. while looping through the list could take up to  9 steps
